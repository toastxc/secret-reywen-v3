# Security Policy

## Versioning

Reywen v2 (Reywen-Revolt) will be maintained for security updates for the next few months once V3 is complete, it will be archived once V3 is complete

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Issues are to be privately disclosed at `security@toastxc.xyz`
Since this is an alpha build I don't expect this to be a major issue


## Best practise

Ensure that everything in Cargo.toml and other dependancies are at the latest stable version
TLS should be set to a minimum version of v3
Do NOT use a production bot for testing, using testing bots removes the risk of token leakage
